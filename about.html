            <p class="p-about"> 
                We are a non-profitable organisation that work to make sure that german shepherds end up in good homes. 
                Because we don’t make a profit, we are dependent on donations and this is one of the reasons we need 
                to get a fee for a donation. Without this donations and fees we would not be able to continue our work.

             What are we doing?
            </h3>
            <p class="p-about"> 
                Our work can begin with a dog that gets abused or is non wanted. We start off by assessing the dog to 
                make sure it will be able to re-adjust. When this is done, we can work on the dog to see what type off 
                family he would fit into. This is done by testing him with a few exercises. Sometimes we can improve 
                this results but in rare cases we have to adopt the dog into a family without kids. And in even rarer 
                cases the dog is unadoptable.

                Why are we doing this?
            </h3>
            <p class="p-about"> 
                We firmly believe that every dog needs a pack that shows love and affection. No animal should need to be 
                stuck and normalise being abused. And this is the short answer to why we do what we do. There are too many
                 animals that needs to be rescued so rather than breeding new animals we need to take care of those ones first.

            Why do you need to pay?
            </h3>

            <p class="p-about"> 
                As said above we do rely on getting donations and the small fee for adoptions, this is to cover the basic 
                needs for the animals. This includes food, shelter, toys, activities, medical attention. Important to see is 
                that the price of an adoption is set a lot lower than the price of a puppy from a breeder, this of course with 
                the intension that the money is off less importance when picking a match for the dogs. But still important 
                enough for us to keep doing this work.<br><b>Pricing for the adoption is currently set at 2000 SEK</b>

            Why german shepherds?
            </h3>
            <p class="p-about"> 
                It’s a breed that is easy learnable and adjusted to each and every family. It’s a guard dog when you need that,
                 it’s a cosy furball when you need that. Thay are extremely willing to learn and eager to please you when 
                 commanding them.
